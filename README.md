# Private Guidebook

The idea behind this application was to allow the user to add descriptions of boulder problems for areas that may not already have a published guidebook, as well as build 'circuits', a list of boulder problems to climb in a day, and calculate the v-point total.

This is a command line based application that utilizes File I/O to allow the user to read in a list of boulders. The user is prompted with a series of menus and has the option to add new boulders, to update existing boulders or delete boulders. All these changes are then taken and the txt file is rewritten with the updated list of boulders.
